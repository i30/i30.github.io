## Block formatting context

Floated elements, absolute elements and block containers that are not block boxes, and block boxes with 'overflow' other than 'visible' (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts for their contents.

## Inline boxes

A principal box of a non-replaced element with `inline` value of `display` property is an **inline box**.

Inline-level boxes, which are generated by replaced inline-level elements or inline-block elements or inline-table elements (e.g., `img`), are called **atomic inline-level boxes**.
