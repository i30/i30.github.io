Xin chao! I'm Dang Vu - a nice name in Vietnamese. Nice to see you here!

I'm a co-founder of [Mina Japanese Center](https://ja.mina.edu.vn) and working as a backend PHP developer at [CleverSoft Solutions](http://cleversoft.co/). Since the jobs is not tough, I'm a freelancer and available for hire.

Fishing, biking and traveling are my favorite activities. If you're going to travel to Vietnam someday, there're always a free room and tour guide for you.

This blog is where I share my thoughts around what I'm thinking and learning about. Hope you will enjoy the content!
