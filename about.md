Hi! I'm Minh Tri. Nice to see you here!

I'm a co-founder of [Mina Japanese Center](https://en.mina.edu.vn) and working as a freelance web developer because coding is cool. Just kidding! :V

Fishing, biking and traveling are my favorite activities. If you're going to travel to Vietnam someday, there're always free rooms and tour guides for you.

This blog is where I share my thoughts around what I'm thinking and learning about. Hope you will enjoy the content!
