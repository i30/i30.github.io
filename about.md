Hi! I'm Minh Tri - written as Minh Tr√≠ in Vietnamese. Nice to see you here!

I'm a web developer focusing on [PHP](http://php.net/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). I also speak [Go](https://golang.org/) quite well.

Fishing, biking and traveling are my favorite activities. If you're going to travel to Vietnam someday, there're always free rooms and tour guides for you.

This site is where I share my public info and my thoughts around what I'm thinking and learning about. Hope you will enjoy the content!
