Hi! I'm Dang Vu - written as "Đặng Vũ" in Vietnamese. Nice to see you here!

I'm a web developer focusing on PHP and JavaScript. I also speak Go and Java quite well.

Fishing, biking and traveling are my favorite activities. If you're going to travel to Vietnam someday, there will be free rooms and tour guides for you.

This site is where I share my public info and my thoughts about what I'm thinking and learning. Hope you will enjoy the content!
