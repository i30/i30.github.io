Xin chao! I'm Dang Vu - a nice name in Vietnamese. Nice to see you here!

I'm working for a small [Japanese Center](https://ja.mina.edu.vn) as a designer and a web developer. Since the jobs is not hard, I'm a freelancer as well. Most of daytime, you will see me playing with my beloved computers. When I'm offline, fishing, biking and traveling are my favorite activities. If you're going to travel to Vietnam someday, there're always a free room and tour guide for you.

This blog is where I share my thoughts around what I'm thinking and learning about. Hope you will enjoy the content!
