Xin chao! I'm Dang Vu - a nice name in Vietnamese. Nice to see you here!

I'm working for a small [Japanese Center](https://ja.mina.edu.vn) as a designer and a web developer. Since the jobs is not tough, I'm a freelancer as well.

Fishing, biking and traveling are my favorite activities. If you're going to travel to Vietnam someday, there're always a free room and tour guide for you.

This blog is where I share my thoughts around what I'm thinking and learning about. Hope you will enjoy the content!
